Why is it that the source of our most intimate and intense emotions are felt in conjunction with things that don't exist?   Does the existential doubt that underlies these imaginary constructions bring the mind into such conflict with itself that it overdoses on the feedback loop?   

Or perhaps it is precisely that the feeling is toward something against which it cannot be checked with the reality principle, that it is able to grow and grow.  My love for other (real) people is constantly checked by their insufferability and their constant complaining.

God and the self suffer no concrete contradictions to diffuse their torment or ecstacy.
